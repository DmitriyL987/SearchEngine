detailed description
  qt provides four classes for handling image data: qimage, qpixmap, qbitmap and qpicture. qimage is designed and optimized for i/o, and for direct pixel access and manipulation, while qpixmap is designed and optimized for showing images on screen. qbitmap is only a convenience class that inherits qpixmap, ensuring a depth of 1. finally, the qpicture class is a paint device that records and replays qpainter commands.
because qimage is a qpaintdevice subclass, qpainter can be used to draw directly onto images. when using qpainter on a qimage, the painting can be performed in another thread than the current gui thread.
the qimage class supports several image formats described by the format enum. these include monochrome, 8-bit, 32-bit and alpha-blended images which are available in all versions of qt 4.x.
qimage provides a collection of functions that can be used to obtain a variety of information about the image. animals car airplane animals animals
