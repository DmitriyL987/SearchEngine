detailed description
a qdir is used to manipulate path names, access information regarding paths and files, and manipulate the underlying file system. it can also be used to access qt's resource system.
qt uses "/" as a universal directory separator in the same way that "/" is used as a path separator in urls. if you always use "/" as a directory separator, qt will translate your paths to conform to the underlying operating system.
a qdir can point to a file using either a relative or an absolute path. absolute paths begin with the directory separator (optionally preceded by a drive specification under windows). relative file names begin with a directory name or a file name and specify a path relative to the current directory.
