CMake Warning (dev) at cmake-build-debug/_deps/googletest-src/googletest/CMakeLists.txt:22 (option):
  Policy CMP0077 is not set: option() honors normal variables.  Run "cmake
  --help-policy CMP0077" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy command to
  set the policy and suppress this warning.

  For compatibility with older versions of CMake, option is clearing the
  normal variable 'gtest_disable_pthreads'.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
